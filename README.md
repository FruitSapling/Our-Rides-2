# Willem van Gerwen BookingGo Technical Test Submission

## Setup

My code includes Jackson as a dependency. The external jar is the "jackson-all-1.9.0.jar" file in the repository.

I built the code in IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2.6 as a jar artifact.
- I include an already-built jar artifact in this repository as OurRides.jar.
- I created this project as a Spring project, so Spring (4.3.18.RELEASE) is a dependency.


## Part 1

This GitHub repository contains my code for Part 1, and was compiled in IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2.6. The jar can be created by adding a JAR artifact and building that artifact. The Jackson library was manually added as a dependency as a downloaded external jar, and then added as a dependency.

### Console application to print the search results for Dave's Taxis

`java -jar "Our Rides 2.jar" "dave" 1.0 1.0 2.3 2.3`

### Console application to filter by number of passengers

To get results from 1.0,1.0 to 2.3,2.3 for 7 passengers:
`java -jar "Our Rides 2.jar" 1.0 1.0 2.3 2.3 7`

## Part 2

My code for part 2 is in another Github Repository: https://github.com/FruitSapling/Our-Rides-Part-2
